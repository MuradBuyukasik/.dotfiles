# Welcome to my new and revised dotfiles!

My UNIX journey led me out of a life-long Stockholm Syndrome that is called Windows. After having used various Linux distros as my daily driver for a few years (Arch btw), I've finally made the move to macOS and have been using it exclusively for my desktop use for the past 2 years since writing this.

Earlier in 2024 I've also discovered NixOS and fell in love with it. Today, all my computing is UNIX based, with macOS on the desktop and NixOS on the server. All managed in this repository, by Nix.

My goal for this repo is to:

* Add new things as I learn
* Make sure I understand every single line of code
* Avoid mindlessly copy-pasting code I don't understand
* Keep it simple

# What you'll find in here

A very incomplete flake! I'm still learning a lot about Nix, and this repo is a reflection of that.

I'm working towards a basic multi-machine config that covers my MacBook Pro, my dedicated servers, local VMs and VPS's.
